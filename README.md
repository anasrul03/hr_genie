# Project Name

A comprehensive README for the project

## Summary
This project aims to develop a mobile application using Flutter, implementing best practices and industry-standard techniques. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture style and incorporates efficient routing navigation, error handling, and form validation using Cubit.

## Features
- MVC Architecture: The project is structured following the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
- Standardized File Naming: The file directories adhere to Flutter's standard conventions, providing consistency and ease of navigation within the codebase.
- Routing Navigation: The entire application employs routing navigation, offering improved maintainability and scalability compared to traditional navigator-based approaches.
- Bottom Navigation Bar: The bottom navigation bar is implemented using routing combined with Cubit, delivering a seamless user experience while navigating between different sections of the app.
- Error Handling and Form Validation: Cubit is utilized for error handling and form validation, enhancing data input functionality and preventing errors.
